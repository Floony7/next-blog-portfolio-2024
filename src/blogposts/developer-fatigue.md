precis: "Burn't out, fatigued as a developer? Tired of the same ole, same ole? Fear not, that frustration and burn out you are experiencing is normal and if you embrace it, you can thrive."

It happens to every developer at some point. You work hard to get to a point where you build a solid base of expertise in a narrow area. Often this is done by working on a particular technology for months and years on end. 

You feel proud that you've reached a high level in say, React and TypeScript, and you likely have a job that is paying you for these skills.

However... You see YouTube videos and articles of other cool things in the web and software development space and feel a sense of dread - "*I don't know any of this and to be honest, I'm a bit bored doing the same thing over and over...*"

You're not alone. While I love my React, Next.js, TypeScript job and background, I have been increasingly feeling the urge to expand my skillset and knowledge. Not just to be a better, more well-rounded dev, but to also feel that exhilaration of learning something completely different.

For that reason, I looked around at things I want to learn but that are also different enough to be fresh and exciting. For me, the ideal candidate was a backend framework, preferably one that leverages my TypeScript knowledge. 

I settled on Nest.js - the Node.js framework for building all kinds of backend applications. I had used Express.js previously, and really liked it's simplicity, but I always felt it left a lot of setup and project structure work to the developer.

Nest.js provides me with the opportunity to build on the skills on existing TypeScript knowledge, it's backend, so that gives me something to build fullstack applications with AND the syntax is remarkably different to React, especially in it's use of TypeScript decorators to infuse the application with functionality.

Apparently, Nest.js leans heavily on the syntax and structure of the Angular frontend framework, the very framework I had demonised for many years because of it's complexity. 

The broader point I want to stress is this - there will be times when you reach a fatigue level in your current work. For devs, that is likely to be programming in a particular way using the same set of tools. This is great, because it usually means you've put the effort in to becoming great at what you do. 

However, use any burnout or boredom from becoming a master in your craft as a springboard to learning something different, complementary or not, to your existing skillset. It will lead to a fresh perspective, new skills, and more excitement for the career path you've ultimately decided is for you.
